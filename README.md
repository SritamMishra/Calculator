## ðŸ’¡ Why I Made This Project

As a freshman just getting into programming, I didnâ€™t want to settle for a basic calculator that only does `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.  
I wanted to explore Python deeper, challenge myself a bit, and build something that feels like a real tool â€” not just a tutorial copy.

This project gave me the chance to:
- Practice **function-based programming**
- Handle **user input and errors** more smoothly
- Implement **math functions** beyond the basics, like trigonometry and factorials
- Focus on **making terminal apps more user-friendly**

More than just a calculator, this project reflects my mindset:
> ðŸ’­ *Even simple things should be done thoughtfully and with polish.*

I built this to learn, experiment, and prove that I'm serious about becoming a real developer â€” right from the start.
